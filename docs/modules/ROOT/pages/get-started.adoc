= Get Started With the Hazelcast CLC
:description: In this tutorial, you'll learn the basics of how to configure the Hazelcast Command-Line Client (CLC), start it, and connect it to a Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} Serverless development cluster and a Serverless production cluster. You'll also see how to switch between clusters, using the Hazelcast CLC. Finally, you'll perform some basic operations on a cluster from the command line and then by running a script to automate the same actions.

{description}

== Before You Begin

You need the following:

- The xref:install-clc.adoc[Hazelcast CLC] installed on your local machine
- Two xref:cloud:ROOT:create-serverless-cluster.adoc[Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} Serverless clusters]. For this tutorial, you'll use one development and one production cluster, to show how you might use the CLC for basic administration and deployment tasks.
- Connection credentials and TLS certificate files for both clusters.

TIP: You can find all connection credentials, such as the cluster name, discovery token, and TLS certificate files in the Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} console. For details, see xref:cloud:ROOT:connect-to-cluster.adoc[]. 

[[step-1-dev-config]]
== Step 1. Configure the Hazelcast CLC for a Development Cluster

Before you can connect the Hazelcast CLC to your development cluster, you need to add the cluster's TLS certificate files and connection details to the default configuration file.

. Save the following files to a location that's easy to find on your local machine. For example: `$HOME/.local/share/*dev*`.

** `ca.pem`
** `cert.pem`
** `key.pem`

. Go to the `$HOME/.local/share/hz-cli` directory and open the `config.yaml` file. This is the default configuration file for the Hazelcast CLC.

. Add the following configuration details for your development cluster:
+
[source,yaml]
----
ssl:
  enabled: true
  capath: "/$PATH/ca.pem"
  certpath: "/$PATH/cert.pem"
  keypath: "/$PATH/key.pem"
  keypassword: "$DEV_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD"
hazelcast:
  cluster:
    name: "$DEV_CLUSTER_NAME"
    cloud:
      token: "$DEV_DISCOVERY_TOKEN"
      enabled: true
----
. Replace the following placeholders:

** `/$PATH/`: The absolute path to the TLS certificate files on your local machine.
** `$DEV_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: The keystore and truststore password for the development cluster.
** `$DEV_CLUSTER_NAME`: The short name for the development cluster. For example: `pr-3145`.
** `$DEV_DISCOVERY_TOKEN`: The discovery token for the development cluster.
. Save your changes.

[[step-2-dev-connect]]
== Step 2. Connect the Hazelcast CLC to the Development Cluster
You're ready to connect the Hazelcast CLC to your development cluster. Make sure that the cluster is running before you start.

. From the command line, change into the `$HOME/.local/share/hz-cli` directory.
. Execute the following command:
+
```bash
export HZ_CLOUD_COORDINATOR_BASE_URL=https://api.viridian.hazelcast.com/
hzc
```
+
The Hazelcast CLC connects to the development cluster and the command prompt displays the cluster details. For example: `hzc hazelcast-cloud@pr-3145>`.
. Press kbd:[Ctrl+C] or type `exit` to shut down the Hazelcast CLC while you complete the configuration for your production cluster.

[[step-3-prod-configure]]
== Step 3. Add Configuration for the Production Cluster
Now add the TLS certificate files and a new configuration file for your production cluster.

. Save the TLS certificate files for the production cluster to a separate directory on your local machine. For example: `$HOME/.local/share/*prod*`.
. Return to the `$HOME/.local/share/hz-cli` directory, make a copy of the `config.yaml` file and save it to the same directory. Give the new file a unique name. For example, `config_prod.yaml`.
. Open the new configuration file and update the following parameters with values for your production cluster.
+
[source,yaml]
----
ssl:
  enabled: true
  capath: "/$PATH/ca.pem"
  certpath: "/$PATH/cert.pem"
  keypath: "/$PATH/key.pem"
  keypassword: "$PROD_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD"
hazelcast:
  cluster:
    name: "$PROD_CLUSTER_NAME"
    cloud:
      token: "$PROD_DISCOVERY_TOKEN"
      enabled: true
----
. Replace the following placeholders:

** `/$PATH/`: The absolute path to the TLS certificate files on your local machine.
** `$PROD_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: The keystore and truststore password for the production cluster.
** `$PROD_CLUSTER_NAME`: The short name for the production cluster. For example: `pr-3145`.
** `$PROD_DISCOVERY_TOKEN`: The discovery token for the production cluster.
. Save your changes.

[[step-4-cluster-switch]]
== Step 4. Switch Between Clusters
Having separate local configurations for your development and production clusters allows you to switch between them without leaving the command line. Make sure both clusters are running before you start.

. From the command line, change into the `$HOME/.local/share/hz-cli` directory.
. Execute the following command to use the default configuration to connect to your development cluster:
+
```bash
hzc
```
+
As before, the Hazelcast CLC connects to your development cluster.
. Type `exit` to return to `$HOME/.local/share/hz-cli`.
. Execute the following command to use the new configuration file for your production cluster.
+
```bash
hzc -c <config_prod>.yaml
```
+
The Hazelcast CLC connects to your production cluster.

[[step-5-write-data]]
== Step 5. Write Data to a Map
Now that you've connected to both your clusters, try using the Hazelcast CLC to write data to a map on your development cluster. A quick and easy way to do this is to use a JSON file.

. Copy the following JSON to a file in the `$HOME/.local/share/hz-cli` directory.
+
.currencycodes.json
```json
{
  "1": {
        "Code": "CAD",
        "Currency": "Canadian Dollar"
      },
  "2": {
        "Code": "INR",
        "Currency": "Indian Rupee"
      },
  "3": {
        "Code": "MXN",
        "Currency": "Mexican Peso"
      },
  "4": {
        "Code": "GBP",
        "Currency": "Pounds Sterling"
      },
  "5": {
        "Code": "TRY",
        "Currency": "Turkish Lira"
      },
  "6": {
        "Code": "USD",
        "Currency": "United States Dollar"
      }
}

```
. As before, from the command line change into the `$HOME/.local/share/hz-cli` directory. This time execute a `put-all` command to write the data from the JSON file to a new map called `currency`.
+
```bash
hzc map put-all -n currency --json-entry currencycodes.json
```
+
The `-n` flag passes the map name to your cluster.

. Do a quick check on your cluster to make sure that your data has been written successfully.
. Open the dashboard of the development cluster and click *Management Center*.
. Go to *Storage* > *Maps*. You'll see that your cluster has a map called `currency` with six entries. 


[[step-6-query-map]]
== Step 6. Query Map Data
You can use SQL to query the data in your `currency` map.

. Start by creating a mapping to the `currency` map.

+
```bash
hzc sql "CREATE MAPPING currency (__key VARCHAR, Code VARCHAR, Currency VARCHAR) TYPE IMap OPTIONS('keyFormat'='varchar', 'valueFormat'='json-flat')"
```
The SQL mapping statement does a number of things:

** Adds column headings for currencies and codes
** Creates a SQL connection to the map
** Tells Hazelcast how to serialize and deserialize the keys and values.

. Try running some simple queries against the `currency` map. For example, this query returns all data in the map and orders it by the currency code.  
+
```bash
hzc sql "SELECT * FROM currency ORDER BY Code"
```
+
The results look like this:

+
[source,shell]
----
+------------+--------------------+--------------------+
|__key       |Code                |Currency            |
+------------+--------------------+--------------------+
|1           |CAD                 |Canadian Dollar     |
|4           |GBP                 |Pounds Sterling     |
|2           |INR                 |Indian Rupee        |
|3           |MXN                 |Mexican Peso        |
|5           |TRY                 |Turkish Lira        |
|6           |USD                 |United States Dollar|
+------------+--------------------+--------------------+

[[step-7-automate]]
== Step 7. Automate Actions
When you're ready, combine the commands that you've learned about so far into a shell script and run them from the command line. 

The script first writes the currency data to a new map called `currencydata` on your development server, queries it and then switches to your production cluster to perform the same actions.
