= clc viridian

This command group provides commands for doing various operations on Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud}, such as creating and managing clusters.

All commands except `viridian login` require the generation of a token using an API key and secret, which you can retrieve from the {hazelcast-cloud} console. Running `viridian login` prompts you for this information, and creates and saves the token.

Usage:

[source,bash]
