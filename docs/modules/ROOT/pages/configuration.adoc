= Configuration for Hazelcast CLC
:description: Hazelcast CLC allows you to configure settings for cluster connection credentials, using a configuration file. Some of those settings may be overriden using global command-line parameters.

{description}

Hazelcast CLC evaluates configuration settings in the following precedence, with items higher on the list taking priority:

. Command-line parameters
. Values in the configuration file

== CLC Configuration File

The CLC configuration file contains all settings for connecting Hazelcast CLC to either a Hazelcast Platform or {hazelcast-cloud} cluster.

The configuration file is written in the YAML file format.

The default configuration file is located at `$HOME/.local/share/hz-cli/config.yaml`. The default settings configure Hazelcast CLC to open an unencrypted connection to a cluster called `dev` at localhost:5701.

To change the configuration settings, you can either edit the default configuration file, or create your own and use the `-c` flag to pass it to Hazelcast CLC:

```bash
clc -c /<PATH>/<FILENAME>.yaml
```

== CLC Configuration with Command-Line Parameters

Command-line parameters are for overriding some configuration settings in the configuration file.

You can override the values in the configuration file by providing the following command-line parameters to any `clc` command:
