== Authenticating with {hazelcast-cloud}

To allow the Hazelcast CLC to do cluster operations, you must generate a {hazelcast-cloud} token.

. Execute the following command to retrieve the {hazelcast-cloud} token.
+
```bash
clc viridian login
```
+
. When prompted, enter your API key and secret. If both are correct, the token is retrieved and saved.

== List Accessible Clusters

Run the following command to list the clusters linked to your Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} account:

```bash
clc viridian list-clusters
```

For each cluster, the following attributes are displayed in order: Cluster ID, Cluster Name, Current Status, Hazelcast Version.

== Importing the Cluster Configuration

Import the configuration of the {hazelcast-cloud} cluster that you want to connect to.

. Run the following command to save the cluster configuration with the name `dev`. Replace the `$CLUSTER_NAME` placeholder with the name of your cluster.
+
```bash
clc viridian import-config $CLUSTER-NAME --name dev
```
. Start an interactive shell session.
+
```bash
clc -c dev
```

CLC will start in the interactive mode, and you should see a command prompt. You're ready to start managing xref:clc-viridian.adoc[{hazelcast-viridian} clusters].

NOTE: The Hazelcast CLC connects to the cluster on demand, that is when you issue a command that requires the connection, such as running a SQL query.
