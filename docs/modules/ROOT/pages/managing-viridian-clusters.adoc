= Managing Clusters on Hazelcast Viridian Cloud Using the Hazelcast CLC

:description: In this tutorial, you'll learn the basics of managing clusters on Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} using the Hazelcast CLC. You'll see how to create, list, and delete clusters, and how to download their logs. You'll also learn how to perform pause/resume operations on the clusters using the Hazelcast CLC.

{description}

== Before You Begin

You need the following:

- xref:install-clc.adoc[Hazelcast CLC] installed on your local machine
- xref:cloud:ROOT:create-account.adoc[{hazelcast-cloud} account]
- xref:cloud:ROOT:developer.adoc[{hazelcast-cloud} API key and secret]

[[step-1-authenticating-with-viridian]]
== Step 1. Authenticating with {hazelcast-cloud}

To allow the Hazelcast CLC to perform cluster operations, you must generate a {hazelcast-cloud} token.

. Execute the following command to retrieve the token. 
+
[source, bash]
----
clc viridian login
----

. When prompted, enter your API key and secret. If both are correct, the output looks like this.
+
[source, bash]
----
Viridian token was fetched and saved.
OK
----
+
If an error is displayed, make sure that your API key and secret are correct and try again.

== Step 2. Create a Cluster

Next, execute the following command to create a development cluster called `my-cluster`.

[source, bash]
----
clc viridian create-cluster --name my-cluster
----

You should see the following output.

[source, bash]
----
Imported configuration: my-cluster
OK
----

[[step-3-list-cluster]]
== Step 3. List Your Cluster Details

To check that the `my-cluster` is up and running, use the following command. 

[source, bash]
----
clc viridian list-clusters
----
The details of all clusters linked to your {hazelcast-cloud} account are returned, including the Cluster ID, Cluster Name, Current Status, Hazelcast Version.

[source, bash, subs="attributes+"]
----
x1qvpphn        my-cluster     RUNNING {full-version}
OK
----

== Step 4. Create Some Data on Your Cluster

Next, write some data to a map on `my-cluster`. 

Creating your cluster using the Hazelcast CLC means that the connection details for the cluster, also called `my-cluster`, are made available to the CLC. If you created the cluster in the console, you would need to import the xref:configuration.adoc[cluster's configuration to connect to it].

. Let's add an entry to a map called `my-map` using a key of `my-key` and a value of `my-value`.
+
[source, bash]
----
clc -c my-cluster map set -n my-map my-key my-value
----

. Now, let's retrieve the value of the key that you just set.

+
[source, bash]
----
clc -c my-cluster map get -n my-map my-key
----
+
You should see the following output.
+
[source, bash]
----
my-value
OK
----

== Step 5. Downloading the Cluster Logs

You can download logs from your cluster to your local machine. Hazelcast CLC gives the cluster logs a standard name, which means that they are overwritten every time you download them to the same location. 

. Run the following command to download the logs of `my-cluster` to your working directory. 
+
[source, bash]
----
clc viridian download-logs my-cluster
----
+
In this command `my-cluster` is the cluster name rather than the configuration name.
+
. Use the following command to quickly check the location of your working directory.
+
[source, bash]
----
clc home
----

. Now, try downloading the logs to a directory of your choice by adding the `--output-dir` flag. Replace the placeholder `$DIRECTORY_PATH` with the absolute or relative path to your chosen directory.
+
[source, bash]
----
clc viridian download-logs my-cluster --output-dir $DIRECTORY_PATH
----

== Step 6. Stop/Resume Your Cluster

To avoid charges accumulating in your account, you can xref:cloud:ROOT:stop-and-resume.adoc[stop a running cluster].

. Try pausing your cluster. You can use either the cluster name or ID.
+
[source, bash]
----
clc viridian stop-cluster my-cluster
----

. When you're ready to resume the cluster, run the following command.
+
[source, bash]
----
clc viridian resume-cluster my-cluster
----

== Step 7. Delete Your Cluster

You can also xref:cloud:ROOT:deleting-a-cluster.adoc[delete an existing cluster] on {hazelcast-cloud} using its name or ID. 

. Run the following command to delete `my-cluster` replacing the placeholder `CLUSTER_ID`. See <<step-3-list-cluster,Step 3>>, for details of how to look up a cluster ID.
+
[source, bash]
----
clc viridian delete-cluster $CLUSTER_ID
----
+
A confirmation message is displayed.
+
[source, bash]
----
Cluster will be deleted irreversibly, proceed? (y/n)
----

. Type `y` to proceed with the deletion.

+
To avoid receiving a confirmation message on cluster deletion, add `--yes` to your command. This may be useful if you are scripting the deletion of multiple clusters.

+
[source, bash]
----
clc viridian delete-cluster my-cluster --yes
----

== Summary

In this tutorial, you learned how to do the following:

* Authenticate with {hazelcast-cloud}.
* Create a cluster and check that it is running.
* Write and retrieve some data from a map.
* Download cluster logs for analysis.
* Pause, resume and delete a cluster.
