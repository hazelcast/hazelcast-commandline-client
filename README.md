# Hazelcast CLC

## Usage Summary

### Home Directory

CLC stores all configuration, logs and other files in its home directory.
We will refer to that directory as `$CLC_HOME`.
You can use `clc home` command to show where is `$CLC_HOME`:
```
$ clc home
/home/guest/.local/share/clc
```

### Configuration

CLC has a simple YAML configuration, usually named `config.yaml`.
This file can exist anywhere in the file system, and can be used with the `--config` (or `-c`) flag:

```
$ clc -c test/config.yaml
```

If there is a `config.yaml` in the same directory with the CLC binary and the configuration was not explicitly set, CLC tries to load that configuration file:
```
$ ls -lh
total 17M
-rwxrwxr-x 1 yuce yuce  17M Nov 26 23:11 clc*
-rw------- 1 yuce yuce  200 Nov 26 23:12 config.yaml
```

`configs` directory in `$CLC_HOME` is special, it contains all the configurations known to CLC.
Known configurations can be directly specified by their names, instead of the full path.
`clc config list` command lists the configurations known to CLC:
```
# List configurations
$ clc config list
default
pr-3066

# Start CLC shell with configuration named pr-3066 
$ clc -c pr-3066
```

If no configuration is specified, the `default` configuration is used if it exists.

#### Configuration format

All paths in the configuration are relative to the parent directory of the configuration file.

* cluster
  * name: Name of the cluster. By default `dev`.
  * address: Address of a member in the cluster. By default `localhost:5701`.
  * discovery-token: Viridian Serverless discovery token.

* ssl
  * ca-path: TLS CA certificate path.
  * cert-path: TLS certificate path.
  * key-path: TLS mutual authentication key certificate path.
  * key-password: Password for the key certificate.

* log
  * path: Path to the log file, or `stderr`. By default, the logs are written to `$CLC_HOME/logs` with the current date as the name.
  * level: Log level, one of: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`. The default is `info`.

Here's a sample Viridian Serverless configuration:
```
cluster:
  name: "pr-3814"  
  discovery-token: "HY8eR7X...."
ssl:
  ca-path: "ca.pem"
  cert-path: "cert.pem"
  key-path: "key.pem"
  key-password: "a6..."
```

### Logging

CLC doesn't log to the screen by default, in order to reduce clutter.
By default, logs are saved in `$CLC_HOME/logs`, creating a new log file per day.
In order to log to a different file, or to stderr (usually the screen), use the `--log.path` flag:

```
# log to object-list.log
$ clc object list --log.path object-list.log

# log to screen
$ clc object list --log.path stderr
```

By default, logs with level `info` and above are logged.
You can use the `--log.level` flag to change the level.
Supported levels: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`

```
# log only errors
$ clc object list --log.level error
```


### Non-interactive Mode

Run commands:
```
$ clc map set my-key my-value
```

Get help:
```
$ clc --help
```

### Interactive (Shell) Mode

Start interactive shell:
```
$ clc
```

Run SQL commands:
```
CLC> select * from cities;
```

Run CLC commands:
```
CLC> \map set my-key my-value
```
 
### Keyboard Shortcuts

The following keyboard shortcuts are available in the interactive-mode:

| Key Binding         | Description                                    |

## Connecting to Viridian Serverless

1. If you don't have a running Viridian Serverless cluster, follow the steps in [Step 1. Start a Viridian Serverless Development Cluster](https://docs.hazelcast.com/cloud/get-started#step-1-start-a-viridian-serverless-development-cluster) to create a cluster.
  Both development and production clusters will work very well.
2. Download the Go client sample for your cluster from the Viridian Console. The sample is typically a Zip file with the following name format: "hazelcast-cloud-go-sample-client-CLUSTER-ID-default.zip". For instance: `hazelcast-cloud-csharp-sample-client-pr-3814-default.zip` 
3. Import the configuration with CLC with `my-cluster` as the name:
  ```
  $ clc config import my-cluster ~/hazelcast-cloud-go-sample-client-pr-3814-default.zip
  ```
4. Check that the configuration is known to CLC:
  ```
  $ clc config list
  default
  my-cluster
  ```
5. In order to use this configuration, use `-c CONFIG_NAME` flag whenever you run CLC:
  ```
  $ clc -c my-cluster map set my-key my-value
  ```

## Generating auto-completion

CLC supports auto-completion in the non-interactive mode for the following shells:
* Bash
* Fish
* Powershell
* Zsh

Run `clc completion SHELL-NAME` command to generate an autocompletion file.
The instructions for each shell is different and can be access by running `clc completion SHELL-NAME --help`:
```
# show the instructions to enable auto-completion for bash
$ clc completion bash --help

# generate the auto-completion for bash and save it to clc.bash
$ clc completion bash > clc.bash
```

## Building from source

The following targets are tested and supported.
The prior versions of the given targets would also work, but that's not tested. 

* Ubuntu 22.04 or better.
* MacOS 12 or better.
* Windows 10 or better.

### Requirements

* Go 1.19 or better
* Git
* GNU Make (on Linux and MacOS)
* Command Prompt or Powershell (on Windows) 
* go-winres: https://github.com/tc-hib/go-winres (on Windows)
 
### 1. Download the source

You can acquire the source using Git:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-commandline-client.git
```

Or download the source archive from https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-commandline-client/archive/refs/heads/main.zip and extract it.

### 2. Build the project

```
$ cd hazelcast-commandline-client
$ make
```

The `clc` or `clc.exe` binary is created in the `build` directory.

### Finally, run the project

CLC starts the in interactive mode by default.

On Linux and MacOS:
```
./build/clc
```

On Windows:
```
.\build\clc.exe
```
